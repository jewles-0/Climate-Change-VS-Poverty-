		<h2>Call Your Senator</h2>

		<p>
			In early March 2020, the House passed a new version of
			<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4229/text"> H.R.4229 Broadband Deployment Accuracy and
				Technological Availability (DATA) Act.</a>. The goal of this bill is to improve how data is collected about where broadband
			does and doesn’t exist. Right now, the internet service providers self report on broadband coverage, but according to
			<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/bill-to-improve-fccs-broadband-mapping-for-rural-america-passes-house-again/">CNET</a>,
			“the FCC last year also called out Verizon, T-Mobile and US Cellular in a report for overstating their wireless coverage.”
			The government gives funding to areas without coverage, so it’s important to give them accurate information.
		</p>

		<br/>

		<p>
			Your action item today is to call your Senator to tell them about your access to broadband coverage and tell them to support
				<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4229/text">H.R.4229 Broadband Deployment Accuracy and
					Technological Availability (DATA) Act.</a>
