      <h2>You Could Be Next</h2>
        <p id=couldBnext> 
          Have you recently noticed an increase in the cost of simple necessities that you use in your daily life? Daily necessities such as packaged bottled water, cooking oil, and the neck-snapping and simultaneously mouth-dropping price of gasoline for your automobile are examples of needed goods that have been increasing in value. Well, there is a simple reason why this is happening. The reason behind such a drastic increase in prices is climate change. The degradation of land and the lackluster amount of nutrients being retained in this land are the consequences of global climate change. It has caused the prices of once simple and affordable items that you once saw in your local stores plentiful to either go away or rise to a dollar or more. This is only the beginning. With the rise of climate change, the prices of food such as fish, corn, and other crops and animal-based products are increasing due to the lack of affordable prices for agricultural producers to yield the same quality results as before. This is only the beginning for developing nations such as South Asian, African, and South American countries that are already experiencing high levels of deforestation and land degradation. Deforestation has caused a lot of effects. Even the price of nuts and fruit has increased in value due to the increasing deforestation that is happening in these forests. Even trees found in Canada needed for the production of tissue paper ( used for tissues, toilet paper, and other paper goods) have been scarce. The scarcity of these trees has increased the value of all of the products that they're being used for. But that is not the only thing that is being affected. Corn is heavily affected by climate change, which has caused products such as oil that is used in cooking and diesel that is used in automobiles to increase in price. With diesel being highly used in automobiles such as boats and other transportation methods, it has caused an increase in exportation prices, and it's only going up with the lack of materials being lowered. Once again, this is only the beginning. These underdeveloped countries are suffering because they are already under political unrest, economic collapse, and exploitation. Even though, under such conditions, these countries are large producers of materials needed to create the everyday products that we, as consumers, use. Do not think that just because you are not as heavily affected as developing countries such as  Nepal, Bolivia, Niger, and other non-developing countries, you are not going to experience the consequences of climate change. The price of things increasing is just the beginning, once these products that you want are no longer as easily available or not as easy to transport due to the cause of climate change. You may not be able to meet the end meat for the needed amount of money to buy things like food and water. Even though a scary reality, the scarcity of products such as food and water is highly likely to occur. This will cause the poverty line to rise in developed nations such as the United States and the European Union. Shocker right?... with these underdeveloped countries being the backbone and sources of some of the products that we use and them being heavily affected by climate change, this will affect us, consumers, in developed countries. This will cause us, consumers in developed nations, to experience a ripple effect. This is only the beginning of a look into the future. Maybe in five to ten years, there will not be as many highly available products for us to use or be easy to purchase due to the high cost of these products. We should be cautious of our everyday activities to lower our carbon footprint and be aware of it. However, this is only the beginning. If we come together as one, as together as a united front, we can help stop global climate change and come to realize that global climate change is going to cause poverty spread rapidly across this Earth.
